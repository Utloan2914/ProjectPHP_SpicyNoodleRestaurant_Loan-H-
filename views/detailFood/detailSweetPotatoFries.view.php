        Sweet potato fries are a fun and healthy version of traditional potato chips. We use sweet potatoes, a tuber that is rich in nutrients and has a unique flavor.
        Sweet potatoes are cut into long bars, creating crispy fried sweet potato sticks. They are then fried in hot oil until they become golden and crispy.
        "Sweet Potato Fries" has the naturally sweet flavor of sweet potatoes, combined with a mild salty taste from spices like salt and pepper. 
        This creates a harmonious balance between sweet and savory flavors, resulting in a very enjoyable eating experience.
